          The overall goal of
          <span class="inline-name"><span>we</span>Eat</span> is it to create an
          application which enables you to quickly get an idea about a food's
          nutrition values or to get inspired by recipes others have shared.
          Sure there are many apps that can do that if you like the pay-wall üí∏
          they all have.. <br /><br />
          <span class="text-emph">Now, where is the problem?</span>
          <br />
          If you have a network where literally anyone can share food nutrition
          values with no central authority you eventually will have data which
          not only seems wrong but is indeed wrong. Somehow
          <span class="inline-name"><span>we</span>Eat</span>
          needs to address this issue..

          <br /><br />
          <span class="text-emph">Verification process</span>
          <br />
          <span class="inline-name"><span>we</span>Eat</span> mitigates this
          issue by having a defined verification process. After a food item has
          been created the process gets triggered and the newly added item runs
          through the verification process. Randomly, users opening the
          application will be asked to verify the newly added item. Unless
          <span class="text-emph">51%</span>
          of the requested users acknowledge that the new item is in-fact
          correct the item will be marked as verified ‚úÖ
