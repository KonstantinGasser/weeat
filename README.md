# weeat 🍏🍒 

## Idea
### Origin story
I downloaded a ton of Apps promising to easily track your food intake and allow to generate meal plans...However, as so very often nowadays each and every App hit me with the classic paywall 😒. For sure yet another $10+ subscription! No not for me - I do it my-self. 

With ***weeat*** you can contribute by adding new food item and even better recipes - all calculations for nutritions are done by the app you just need a name and look for the ingredients 😎! 

Even better with only one click ***weeat*** generates you a complete set of meals for a day (breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack???🤤) where you can set the maximum for things like the maximum *kcal* or minimum for the *proteins* across all three meals.

### First visit

The first time you visit the app you will be assigned a random user name which gets stored in a cookie on the client side. The cookie is valid until the end of the day the cookie has been created. The cookie is optional however, with the cookie tough, you can track your daily intake which without the cookie will not work. After the day has passed your use name, cookie and its mapped data will be deleted. At no point in time can the mapped data be liked to you, no device/IP information of you will be registered just the random user name that for this day belongs to you :).

### Obstacles
Having a network were everyone can create content, can add foods and share recipes offers the potential that not all of the information is correct 😐. To mitigate this problem ***weeat*** allows to flag an item at any time. Once an item has reached its maximum allowed flags it is send to be reviewed. Since the complete content relies in the hand of the network N users will be selected at random to review the item.
Only if ***51%*** of the requested users acknowledge that the content is in fact correct, it will be marked as verified.
This will help to ***ensure*** that you can trust the content 🤝

*However...*

After the verification process items might still be incorrect 😠... This is why each verified item can be reported as incorrect at any time . Reporting an item will trigger the verification process again. Again a number of random users will be asked to review and verify the item. Let's see how intelligence the swarm is 😅
