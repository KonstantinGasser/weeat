# weeat 🍏🍒 

## Idea
### Origin story
I downloaded a ton of Apps promising to easily track your food intake and allow to generate meal plans...However, as so very often nowadays each and every App hit me with the classic paywall 😒. For sure yet another $10+ subscription! No not for me - I do it my-self. 

With ***weeat*** you can contribute by adding new food item and even better recipes - all calculations for nutritions are done by the app you just need a name and look for the ingredients 😎! 

Even better with only one click ***weeat*** generates you a complete set of meals for a day (breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack???🤤) where you can set the maximum for things like the maximum *kcal* or minimum for the *proteins* across all three meals.

### First visit

The first time you visit the app you will be assigned a random user name which gets stored in a cookie on the client side. The cookie is valid until the end of the day the cookie has been created. The reason the cookie is required, is because to can track your intakes over a day. 
 
*In a later version of ***weeat*** there will be the option to create a user account in order to view a history of your data and do some more things 🤫*

### Obstacles
Having a network were everyone can create content, add foods and share recipes offers the potential that not all of the information is correct 😐. To mitigate this problem ***weeat*** requests N random users from the network to verify the newly uploaded content.
Only if ***51%*** of the requested users acknowledge that the content is in fact correct, it will be marked the as verified.
This will help to ***ensure*** that you can trust the content 🤝

*However...*

After the verification process items might still be incorrect 😠... This is why each verified item can be reported as incorrect at any time . Reporting an item will trigger the verification process again. The requested users will be >= than the requested users from the previous iteration. And you can always correct the network if you find that something is wrong 😇!
